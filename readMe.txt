1. How to filter email ids
2. How to delete emails
3. How to download attachments (this is my favorite)
4. How to run the code on startup

Note: All the links are in the description so watch full video and then head to code and other links.

1. How to filter email ids: -
                    To filter email ids, all you have to do is add an if condition in code to the email from variable which will filter out your emails.

2. How to delete emails - 
                  Add a filter and us imaplib my_mail.store where u will set the flag for the email as deleted

3. Download attachments - 
                 use walk function and check for multipart and disposition validations and get filenames

4. Run code on startup -
               Store the code in this location -
